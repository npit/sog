# Symmetric Observer-Gatherer

This is a modification of the observer / navigator task described in [Kajic et al.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WExQjcrcFBhb1PoxzMNvxqzeJKHqpFd9/view), under development. A workshop paper describing the environment and related empirical validations for betrayal emergence, detection and penalization is available in a [2022 MLSafety NeurIPS workshop paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=hTPsrAdtIhT).

### Usage 

- Use `run.py` to train / evaluate policies. Checkout `python run.py --help`.
- Set `example_standalone.py` for an example using the environment in a standalone manner.
